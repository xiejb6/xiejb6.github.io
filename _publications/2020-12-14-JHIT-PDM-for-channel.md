# Abstract

In this study, the direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow combined with Parallel Direct Method of DNS (PDM-DNS) are performed, and high parallel efficiency is obtained. A parallel efficiency of over 95% can be achieved on 256 cores of the Tianhe-2 supercomputer. Statistics of four cases with $Re_{\tau}$=176, 544, 960 and 2000 have been compared with the Lee&Moser’s results and the reliability is verified. Further, based on the advantage of finite-difference with immersed boundary condition easy to deal with wall boundary condition, a simulation added local burr band at $Re_{\tau}$=176 has been performed to realize research of complex boundary condition. The proposed method provides a new tool for the study of turbulent channel flow with complex boundary condition.
