# Abstract

To investigate the flow regularity of smoke in the subway station, Fire Dynamics Simulator is used to study the fire smoke spread in the Higher Education Mega Center North Station. The boundary conditions required for numerical simulation are determined based on the measured temperature and air velocity in the subway station. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Massive Passage Interface (MPI) are used to do realistic view simulation of the subway platform. As the result shows, when a fire breaks out in the middle of the platform, smoke concentration, CO concentration and temperature on the left part of the platform are about 133 percent, 75 percent and 41 percent respectively higher than those on the right part. Therefore, the right part of the platform is more secure for personnel evacuation.
