I am now a postgraduate student in Mechanics at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), conducting research on large-scale turbulence direct numerical simulation (DNS) under the guidance of Prof. Yun Bao. In 2019, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at SYSU and graduated as an excellent undergraduate.

Although I majored in mechanics, I am actually very interested in high-performance computing (HPC). In my senior year of undergraduate study, I was fortunate to join the Student Cluster Competition Team of SYSU ([SYSU-SCC](https://github.com/SYSU-SCC)) and enjoyed learning parallel computing and code optimization. At the same time, I provided optimization suggestions for HPC applications in fluid mechanics domain to the team members. To be honest, my subsequent research on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) benefits a lot from this experience. If possible, I hope to continue my PhD study in the intersection of HPC & CFD.
